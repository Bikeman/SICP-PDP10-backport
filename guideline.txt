Some guidelines for the conversion:

Overall guideline: 
==================

The goal is to leave SCHEME in the ITS PiDP-10 emulation unchanged and rather adapt the 
examples to work with it. This is debatable, one could also try to add features of newer SCHEME to the 
R2RS (?) version used in the simulated MIT KA (with macros perhaps), but that would be a different project.
For now let us stick to the historic SCHEME implementation as much as we can.

Instead, the examples from SICP should be re-written as if SICP had been written at the time of ITS.

Some easy conversions
=====================

Numeric literals
----------------
Where necessary, mark numeric literals as decimal with a trailing period

Syntax of define
----------------

definitits of functions need to be rewritten as (define foo (lambda (....) ....))
definitions for values other than functions cannot be done with define.
